# IMPORTANT - This module is no longer maintained

I no longer have an active couchdb project, so maintaining this driver has become
very hard for me. For now I have decided to stop maintainence until either:

* Somebody steps up and wants to become the maintainer
* I have an active couchdb project again

Meanwhile I can recommend you to watch [this jsconf.eu video](http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/nodejs_couchdb_crazy_delicious.html)
where [Mikeal Rogers](https://github.com/mikeal) from [CouchOne](http://www.couch.io/) looks at the various available modules.
