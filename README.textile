h1. Codeshelver

Codeshelver lets you clean up your GitHub watchlist by storing repositories
you would like to remember on your shelve. You can tag any repository and
search for it later on - until then it won't spam your dashboard timeline.

h2. Extending the app

Go ahead and add the features you are missing. Send me pull requests and I'll
be glad to integrate your additions and deploy them to "codeshelver.com":http://codeshelver.com
